**Formula 1 Prediction Model**
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model to predict Formula 1 race outcomes based on historical data. The model aims to forecast the finishing positions of drivers using a variety of features such as driver and constructor details, race statistics, and more.

Notebook Details
Notebook Name: submission-csv(3).ipynb
Purpose: To develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting Formula 1 race outcomes.
Tools Used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
Contents
Data:

Detailed Formula 1 race results, driver statistics, constructor details, and race statuses spanning multiple seasons.
Features include driver ID, constructor ID, grid position, points scored, laps completed, race status, etc.
Preprocessing:

Handling missing data using mean imputation for both features and target variables.
Scaling features using StandardScaler to normalize the data.
Modeling:

Utilizing Random Forest Regressor and Naive Bayes (Gaussian) for prediction tasks.
Model evaluation based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Results:

Generating predictions for the test dataset.
Creating a submission file (submission.csv) containing predicted positions and additional driver standings.
